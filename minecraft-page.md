Minecraft is a Game made by Mojang (on Java) in which the user survives, mines, fights and builds amazing creations like the one below -

Minecraft can be played as singleplayer (on the users computer without internet) or multiplayer on server with the users friends or random people (_pvp_).
<br />

There are many Minecraft servers on the internet. Thousands of people play on them. My favourite game is Skywars in which users get stuff from chests and fight each other in the sky.
