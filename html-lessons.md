# Html

## [](#header-1)About -
Html is **the _easiest_ language ever** and is as easy to read as english. It is the languages that is used to create websites and webpages and is read by browsers like internet explorer and safari or google chrome. Html's full form is
<br />
_HyperText **Markup** Language_
<br />
This means that HyperText is the internet, markup is used to style the content like underlining it or highlighting it and language is that web pages communicate through it.

### [](#header-3)Starting Html -
To start a html document, open any text editor such as notepad or text edit and save a file with a extension of .html
Then when you open the file, it will open your default browser and display what is inside the Html document. Right now there is nothing in it so it wont display anything.
<br />
<br />
### [](#header-3)Putting stuff inside the Html document -
To put stuff in the Html document, right click and open with any text editor and first type in this code -
<br />
```
<html>
</html>
```
<br />
This code will tell the browser that the type of document it is reading is Html and not something else. Then the <html></html> code beneath it is where the Html document starts. All the main Html content is put between these tags.
<br />
<br />
Everything has a head and a body so add a head and body to the html document inside the <html></html> thing.
<br />
```
<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```
<br />
The <> and </> signs are used to define how the content in them is displayed on the screen like a big or small text or a hyperlink. Nearly everything has a duplicate in this Html document because Html nearly every html thing (element) has a opening **_tag_** and a closing **_tag_**. This is done so that the browser knows when to stop the data inside the tags like a change of color or font size.
<br />
IMPORTANT - In Html 5, a _!DOCTYPE html_ tag has to be put at the start of a document. It should be in between <> but I cant show it as it is not allowed in this language (github markdown).
