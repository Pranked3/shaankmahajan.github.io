# [](#header-1)Java
<br />
<br />
## [](#header-1)About -
Java is a programming language which is used to create apps and games like Minecraft. It requires a jdk (java developement kit). I recommend eclipse or netbeans as a IDE. So lets learn some java :-
<br />
<hr />
<br />
### [](#header-3)Executing java thought terminal -
<br />
First open your shell(terminal/cmd or something) and navigate to you directory where your .java file is present :-
<br />
```
$ cd path-to-your-file
```
<br />

Then once your jdk is installed, do these commands :-
<br />
<br />
```
$ javac filename.java
$ java filename
```
<br />
After doing the javac command then wait a while till the command completes(java being compiled). errors in your code will be displayed using the javac command.
<br />
The java command will execute the file and display everything in the terminal window or open another window if you java code is like that.
<br />
<hr />
<br />
## Let's Learn java now -
<br />
The first thing you need to do is open notepad or any text editor and save the file as (filename.java). Then do this in the file -
<br />
```
public class filename {}
```
<br />
This will create a class of the filename(will be explained later).
IMPORTANT - The filename saved and in the thing above should be exactly the same (just without the .java in the example above).
<br />
<hr />
<br />
## Main Executing thing -
<br />
All the stuff that you want to be executed when the app starts will be put inside this (which is inside the class above).s
<br />
```
public static void main(String[] args) {}
```
<br />
All the stuff that you want to be executed will be put inside the parenthesis {}.
<br />
<hr />
<br />
## Printing stuff -
To print stuff into the console use this -
<br />
```
System.out.println("Hello World/viewers");
```
<br />
#### Remember that java is a **case sensitive language** so remember the __CAPITAL and small LETTERS__ of the command above. Also after doing any command in java you HAVE to put a ; or the code won't run.
<br />
Try running the code above in the {} of the main executing thing. You have created your first java code :D
