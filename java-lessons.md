# [](#header-1)Java
<br />
<br />
## [](#header-1)About -
Java is a programming language which is used to create apps and games like Minecraft. It requires a jdk (java developement kit). First so execute java (on macs. Use Eclipse on Windows) :-
<br />
<hr />
<br />
### [](#header-3)Executing java thought terminal -
<br />
First open your terminal (bash) and navigate to you directory where your .java file is using :-
<br />
```
$ cd path-to-your-file
```
<br />

Then once your jdk is installed, do these commands :-
<br />
<br />
```
$ javac filename.java
$ java filename
```
<br />
After doing the javac command then wait a while till the command completes(java being compiled). errors in your code will be displayed using the javac command.
<br />
The java command will execute the file and display everything in the terminal window or open another window if you java code is like that.
<br />
<hr />
<br />
### Let's Learn java now -
<br />
The first thing you need to do is open notepad or any text editor and save the file as (filename.java). Then do this in the file -
<br />
```
public class filename {}
```
<br />
This will create a class of the filename(will be explained later).
IMPORTANT - The filename saved and in the thing above should be exactly the same (just without the .java in the example above).
